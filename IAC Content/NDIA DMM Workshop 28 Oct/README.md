# DMM Workshop:  Implementing A Digital Technical Review Process
The DMM IAC workshop was held in conjunction with the 27th Annual NDIA Systems & Mission Engineering Conference in Norfolk, VA on October 28, 2024.

## Event Details
Monday, 10/28, 1:30pm-5pm EST
Led By: Lt. Col. Ryan Pospisal, Director, AFMC Digital Acceleration Task Force (DATF)
Location: 27th Annual NDIA Systems & Mission Engineering Conference in Norfolk, VA
About the Workshop!
Engage with industry and domain experts to identify challenges, approaches, and solutions for conducting digital-based, accelerated, and continuous design reviews (e.g. System Engineering Technical Reviews, SETRs).  We seek insights on current successes and challenges towards leveraging digital material management, enhancing efficiency and effectiveness in this area.  Desired Outcome: Establish best practices for digital program reviews, standardize approaches across government organizations to boost industry efficiency, identify traditional risks, and identify capability gaps for tool vendors and DMM service providers to target in product development.

Preparation is Key!!
Come prepared to this IAC Workshop by reviewing the Digital SETR Gate Criteria and SETR Background provided by SAF/AQR (located on the DMM IAC Sharing site) – please bring your thoughts and recommendations on these reviews:  Systems Requirements Review (SRR),  Systems Functional Review (SFR),  Preliminary Design Review (PDR), Critical Design Review (CDR), Test Readiness Review (TRR),  System Verification Review/Functional Configuration Audit (SVR/FCA), Production Readiness Review (PRR), and Physical Configuration Audit (PCA).

About the IAC Workshop Breakout Sessions!
The first breakout session will encompass your thoughts and experiences with technical reviews and moving forward with digital materiel management in mind!  This session will also dive deeper into the specific review checklists as outlined in these documents.   In the second breakout, we look forward to working with our visionaries and shift our focus to an unencumbered digital future state – no need to focus on what may hinder the success of this future state.  So no worries on current policy, funding, intellectual property, technology limitations, etc.!
